## Code explanation:



This code is a Python script that creates a simple GUI-based calculator using the Tkinter library. Tkinter is a standard GUI library in Python that allows you to create windows, widgets, and other graphical user interface elements. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. `import tkinter as tk`: This line imports the Tkinter library and gives it the alias `tk` for easier use.

2. `def on_button_click(button_text)`: This is a function that gets called whenever a button on the calculator is clicked. It takes the text of the clicked button as input.

3. `current_text = result_var.get()`: This line gets the current text displayed in the result entry widget and stores it in the variable `current_text`.

4. `if button_text == "=":`: This checks if the clicked button is the equal sign "=".

5. `try: result = eval(current_text)`: If the equal sign is clicked, the code tries to evaluate the current expression using the `eval()` function. The `eval()` function takes a string as input and evaluates it as a Python expression. For example, if `current_text` is "1+2", `eval(current_text)` will return 3.

6. `result_var.set(result)`: If the evaluation is successful, the result is set as the value of the `result_var` variable. This variable is bound to the `textvariable` attribute of the result entry widget, so the result will be displayed in the entry.

7. `except Exception as e: result_var.set("Error")`: If an exception occurs during the evaluation (e.g., the expression is invalid), the code catches the exception and sets the result entry widget's value to "Error".

8. `else: result_var.set(current_text + button_text)`: If the clicked button is not the equal sign, it means it's a digit, operator, or a decimal point. In this case, the clicked button's text is appended to the current expression in the result entry widget.

9. The code then proceeds to create the main window using `tk.Tk()` and sets its title to "Simple Calculator" and size to 300x400 pixels.

10. `result_var = tk.StringVar()`: This line creates a `StringVar` instance to store the text displayed in the result entry widget.

11. `result_var.set("")`: This sets the initial value of the result entry widget to an empty string.

12. `result_entry = tk.Entry(root, textvariable=result_var, font=("Helvetica", 24), bd=5, justify="right")`: This line creates the result entry widget, which is used to display the current expression and the result. It is bound to the `result_var` variable, and the font, border (bd), and text alignment (justify) are configured.

13. `result_entry.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)`: This packs the result entry widget into the main window, allowing it to fill horizontally and vertically.

14. The code then defines a list of buttons for the calculator, where each row is represented as a tuple.

15. It uses nested loops to create the buttons and pack them into frames to organize them better.

16. The buttons are created using the `tk.Button` class, and a lambda function is used as the command. The lambda function ensures that the correct `button_text` is passed to the `on_button_click` function when a button is clicked.

17. Finally, the main event loop is started using `root.mainloop()`. This loop waits for events, such as button clicks, and handles them accordingly.

When you run the code, a window will appear with a simple calculator GUI. You can perform basic arithmetic operations using the buttons, and the result will be displayed in the entry widget.
